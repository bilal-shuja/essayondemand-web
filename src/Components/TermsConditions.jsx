              If a User and Writer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the User and Writer. User and Writer have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract.

              YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, AGREE, AND UNDERSTAND THAT ESSAYONDEMAND IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY SERVICE CONTRACT, THAT THE FORMATION OF A SERVICE CONTRACT BETWEEN USERS AND WRITERS WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, CREATE AN EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER SERVICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ESSAYONDEMAND AND ANY WRITER OR A PARTNERSHIP OR JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN ESSAYONDEMAND AND ANY USER.
              </p>
              <p>
              With respect to any Service Contract, Users and Writers may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Essayondemand’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement.

                <b>4. ESSAYONDEMAND FEES</b>
              </p>
              <p>
              Writers pay Essayondemand a Service Fee for the use of the Site. Essayondemand charges service fees to Sellers for using the Site’s communication services. The Service Fees (to use the Site and Site Services) are paid solely by Writer. When a User pays a Writer for a Project, Essayondemand will credit the Writer Account for the full amount paid and then subtract and disburse to Essayondemand the Service Fee. WRITER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AUTHORIZES AND INSTRUCTS ESSAYONDEMAND TO DEDUCT THE SERVICE FEE FROM THE WRITER ACCOUNT AND PAY ESSAYONDEMAND ON WRITER’S BEHALF.
              </p>

              <p>
              5.1 NON-PAYMENT
              </p>
              <p>
              If User is in <b> “default”,</b> meaning the User fails to pay the Writer Fees or any other amounts when due under the Terms of Service, Essayondemand will be entitled to the remedies described in this agreement and in addition to such other remedies that may be available under applicable law or in such written agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
              If User is in default, Essayondemand may, without notice, temporarily or permanently close User’s Account and revoke User’s access to the Site and Site Services, including User’s authority to use the Site to process any additional payments, enter into Service Contracts, or obtain any additional Services (if applicable) through the Site. However, User will remain responsible for any amounts that accrue on any open Projects at the time limitation is put on the User’s Account as a result of the default. Without limiting other available remedies, User must pay Essayondemand upon demand for any amounts owed, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection to the extent permitted by applicable law.
              </p>

              <p>
              5.2 PAYMENT METHODS
              </p>
              <p>
              In order to use certain Site Services, User must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method.
              </p>
              <p>
              User hereby authorizes Essayondemand to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by User, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as User’s method of payment consistent with our Privacy Policy, and to charge User’s credit card (or any other Payment Method) for the Writer Fees and any other amounts owed under the Terms of Service. To the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers to process payments and manage your Payment Method information.
              </p>
              <p>
              By providing Payment Method information through the Site and authorizing payments with the Payment Method, User represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) User is legally authorized to provide such information; (b) User is legally authorized to make payments using the Payment Method(s). When User authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, User represents and warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other Terms of Service cannot be collected from User’s Payment Method(s), User is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.
              </p>
              <p>
              Because the use of any Payment Method may be limited by applicable law or by written agreement with your financial institution, Essayondemand is not liable to any User or Writer if Essayondemand does not complete a transaction as a result of any such limit, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an account associated with such Payment Method.

               <b>5.3 PAYMENT PROCESS</b>
             </p>
             <p>
             Placing an order on the Site for any job/project is free. However, you must deposit funds after you accept the bid of a Writer. You can also add money to your store balance any time to use this money for new orders. You shall release the agreed fee on completion and delivery of the Writer Services by the Writer and once the outcome of Writer Services is accepted by you; either in installments or in one lump sum on completion of the Service Contract, based on the terms thereof. After the final outcome of Writer Services was uploaded (100% completion is stated in your order) you have 3 days to send us any complaints or revision requests. We send you additional email after 3 days have passed to remind about the payment for the Writer Services performed under Service Contract.
             </p>
             <p>
             If there are no complaints sent by you using any of the available methods of contact, the money will be released to the writer automatically on the 4th day after the termination of Service Contract. Please, review your order carefully before releasing the full amount of money reserved for the Service Contract. Once the entire agreed sum is received by the Writer, it is deemed that the outcome of Writer Services is complete and is to your satisfaction; therefore, no refund will be possible.
             </p>
             <p>
             If you do not plan to use Site Services further, we will be allowed to withdraw the money after sending an appropriate request. We ensure fund withdrawal from the User's account upon request, if such a request is made within a year from the last order date. If you use money from your balance after the request was sent to us, we reserve the right to reject your request and close the ticket. If you have previously cancelled the order and money was returned to your balance, we reserve the right to investigate the reason of cancellation and make a decision to either approve or decline your withdrawal request based on the results of this investigation. If money on your balance has never been used before, we will refund it within 3-10 business days after the request is placed.
             </p>
             <p>
             Money shall be stored in your personal account for six months following delivery of the last order. User keeps his right to make request regarding the return of unused money to us within six months from the moment of receiving the last order. After expiration of six months, unused money shall be transferred to us on account of paying for operating charges.
             </p>
             <p>
             A chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that a User files with their card issuer or financial institution), and any subsequent reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow such instructions.
             </p>
             <p>
             You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Writers through the Site, as well as any processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us on those chargebacks and reversals.
             </p>
             <p>
             You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors). If you initiate any chargeback request or other “Request for Information” or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.

                    Unless both you and Essayondemand expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein. You may provide written notice to us. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Site and Site Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed. Essayondemand is not a party to any Service Contract between Users and Writers. Consequently, the User understands and acknowledges that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract or Project entered into between Users and Writers. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree that (a) you hereby instruct Essayondemand to close any open contracts; (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site; (c) Essayondemand will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Project or related transaction between you and the Writer; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Essayondemand for any Site Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Writers for any Writer Services.

If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account, a different Account, or register under a new Account without Essayondemand’s prior written consent.

                  Before serving a demand for arbitration of a Claim, you and Essayondemand agree to first notify each other of the Claim. You agree to notify Essayondemand of the Claim and Essayondemand agrees to provide to you a notice at your email address on file (in each case, a <b>“Notice”</b> ).

Both you and Essayondemand will have 60 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.
